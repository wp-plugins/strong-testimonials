<h3>Page Builder Integration Continues</h3>

<p>
Drag-and-drop page builder plugins and themes store content differently. This plugin has to find the <code>[strong]</code> shortcodes in each page in order to know which stylesheets and scripts to load. This is called <strong>conditional loading</strong> and it's a best practice that improves your site's speed. Without conditional loading, all the plugin's stylesheets and scripts, like the slideshow and pagination, would be loaded on <em>every page</em> even if they were not needed, resulting in slow, bloated pages.
</p>

<p><em>(I wonder how much internet bandwidth is used for sites without conditional loading?)</em></p>

<h3>The road ahead: In clay, not stone.</h3>

<h4>Version 1.16</h4>

<p>
Includes drag-and-drop ordering in the testimonial list. It is <em>disabled by default</em> and can be enabled on the Testimonials Settings page. It is an option in the widget and by using <code>menu_order</code> in the <code>[strong]</code> shortcode.
</p>

<h4>Version 1.17 (current)</h4>

<p>
Integration with the excellent <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-nocaptcha-recaptcha/" target="_blank">Advanced noCaptcha reCaptcha plugin</a>. The spam battle rages on!
</p>
<p>
New Arabic and Portuguese translations, and updated Spanish and French translations. Many thanks to our trusty translators.
</p>

<h4>Version 1.18</h4>

<p>
I have taken the feedback to heart. The <code>[strong]</code> shortcode is either too complex or half-baked, depending on your viewpoint.
</p>

<p>
This version will introduce <strong>views</strong> which will replace the shortcode "language" with something like <code>[strong view="1"]</code> and all the settings will be in admin. This has been the goal from the start. It is a better approach for both you and me.
</p>
<p>
The <code>[strong]</code> shortcode and all its options will remain for those who like it.
</p>

<h4>Version 2.0</h4>

<p>
Strong is my project for learning plugin development and is nowhere near mature. I do not believe in "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". I do not believe in "lite" versions. This plugin will continue to evolve. And I will continue to support you; as much as you allow, anyway.
</p>

<p>
Version 2.0 will use more modern development methods and allow deeper customization and integration with themes and plugins. It will be stronger.
