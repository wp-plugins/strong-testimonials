== Description ==

Strong Testimonials by [WP Mission](http://www.wpmission.com) makes testimonials simple.

* **Show** with a variety of shortcodes or in a widget with transition effects.
* **Collect** through a customizable form with anti-spam options.
* **Manage** in the post editor including Featured Images and Categories.


= This is a work in progress. =

If you cannot tolerate occasional bugs and frequent updates, then please consider another plugin. 

On the other hand, if you want to participate in this plugin's development and the prompt, personal attention of its developer, then welcome aboard! You have been warned :)


= Coming Soon =

* Get involved by voting on feature requests.
* A vastly improved version 2.0 with flexible display components!


= What's New =

* Both the widget and the cycle shortcode can
  1. show an **excerpt** of a testimonial, the entire content, or up to a certain length;
  1. show a "Read more" link to the full testimonial or another page;
  1. show the title, the featured image, and the client information.

* The widget also 
	1. can have multiple widgets on a page, each with their own cycle settings;
	1. has better slide element handling and container spacing for improved compatibility.
  
* You can skip loading the included stylesheets if you want to style it from the ground up.

* Improved theme compatibility (YMMV). Tested in many popular themes including the [problematic](http://chrislema.com/wordpress-obesity/) [Avada](http://www.fklein.info/2013/05/overloaded-theme-problems/).

* Improved i18n. Ready for translations.


= Primary Features =

* A customizable testimonial submission **form** with **anti-spam** options.
* Administrator **notification** upon new testimonial submission.
* Multiple **shortcodes** including Cycle, All, Random, and Single.
* Multiple **widget** options including category selection and random order.
* Support for **excerpts** in both the cycle shortcode and widgets.
* Use the WordPress post editor to **add and edit** testimonial content, including **thumbnail support** and **categories**.

= Inspiration =

This is based on the popular [GC Testimonials](http://wordpress.org/plugins/gc-testimonials/). I have been very active in that plugin's support forum because I like its simplicity, I have used it on many sites, and I love to fix things.

Strong aims to pick up where GC Testimonials left off while maintaining its simplicity.


= Anti-Spam =

Instead of reinventing the anti-spam wheel, Strong integrates other plugins to do the heavy lifting. Because spam is heavy and modular is stronger.

To add CAPTCHA to the testimonial submission form:

1. install one of these supported plugins,
1. select that plugin on the `Testimonials > Settings` page.

Currently supported CAPTCHA plugins:

* [Captcha](http://wordpress.org/plugins/captcha/) by BestWebSoft
* [Simple reCAPTCHA](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-recaptcha) by WP Mission
* [Really Simple Captcha](http://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/) by Takayuki Miyoshi

Notes

* If the currently selected CAPTCHA plugin is deactivated, the setting will revert to "None".
* I plan to add an option for Akismet soon.
* [Contact me](http://www.wpmission.com/contact) if you have a plugin recommendation.


= Recommended =

* [Simple Custom CSS](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/) (fully compatible)
* [Wider Admin Menu](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wider-admin-menu/) (fully compatible)

= Known Conflicts =

* [WP Mail SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/) - The administrator notification email may not be sent. I am working on this.
* [Page Builder by SiteOrigin](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/siteorigin-panels) - The widget settings are not being saved properly in the drag-and-drop builder. I am working on this.

I apologize for the lack of documentation. Adding features has taken precedence recently.

The default settings are designed to help you hit the ground running. Add the submission form shortcode to a page to start collecting testimonials. You can change the fields on the form in the fields editor. Other shortcodes and widgets allow you to display testimonials in various ways. 

If you have any questions or need help, use the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/strong-testimonials) or [contact me](http://www.wpmission.com/contact/).



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When using the Page Builder plugin, I can add a widget to a panel but the settings are not being saved. =
There seems to be a problem with radio buttons in [Page Builder](http://wordpress.org/plugins/siteorigin-panels/). I have notified the developer and I am trying to find a workaround.

= Why is "Fade" the only transition effect? =
See this [support thread](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/settings-bug-1).

= How can I change the fields on the form? =
On the `Testimonials > Fields` page, there is a field editor where you can add or remove fields, change field details, and drag-n-drop to reorder them. You can also restore the default fields. 

If you have ever used the Advanced Custom Fields or Custom Field Suite plugins, the editor will be very familiar.

Here is a [tutorial](http://www.wpmission.com/tutorials/customize-the-form-in-strong-testimonials/) - more to follow. Use the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/strong-testimonials) if you need help.

= How can I change which client information appears below the testimonial? =
On the `Client Section` tab on `Testimonials > Settings` page. Follow the example to build shortcodes based on your custom fields. There is a shortcode for text fields (like a client's name) and a shortcode for links (like a client's website). When in doubt, use the default template provided.

I admit it can greatly improved but I needed to build something quickly to include in version 1.7 with custom fields. This will be replaced with a field editor in an upcoming version.

Use the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/strong-testimonials) if you need help.

= Is this multisite compatible? =
Yes, but I highly recommend first installing the [Proper Network Activation](http://wordpress.org/plugins/proper-network-activation/) plugin when adding Strong Testimonials to a multisite installation. That plugin will deftly handle the plugin activation process, thus ensuring each site has the default settings.

= Will it import my existing testimonials? =
Not yet. If you have a ton of testimonials, you may want to wait.

= What about Akismet for the submission form? =
I plan to integrate Akismet soon.

= I modified my copy of GC Testimonials and I want to keep my features. =
I will gladly help add your modifications to a custom version of Strong Testimonials. In reality, I will likely steal your features and add them to a new version. You have been warned.

= I spent a lot of time adjusting the CSS to get GC Testimonials to work with my theme. Can I expect to do the same with this version? =
1. I simplifed the CSS so it will inherit as much from your theme as your other content and widgets, so you can probably trim down any custom CSS.
1. I will gladly help you sort it out.
