*[Check out the screenshots for a better overview](http://wordpress.org/plugins/strong-testimonials/screenshots/).*


** Anti-Spam **

Instead of reinventing the anti-spam wheel, Strong integrates other plugins to do the heavy lifting. Because spam is heavy and modular is stronger.

Currently supported Captcha plugins:

* [Captcha](http://wordpress.org/plugins/captcha/) by BestWebSoft
* [Really Simple Captcha](http://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/) by Takayuki Miyoshi
* [Simple reCaptcha](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-recaptcha) by WP Mission

Notes

* More options coming soon.
* If your site relies on a partner plugin like this, and that plugin becomes buggy or abandoned, I will adopt it or integrate it to keep your site running.
* [Contact me](http://www.wpmission.com/contact) if you have a plugin recommendation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a Captcha to the form? =

Select one of the supported plugins on the `Testimonials > Settings` page. Use the link to each plugin's download page to install it.

If the currently selected Captcha plugin is deactivated, the setting will revert to "none".

= How can I change the fields on the form? =

On the `Testimonials > Fields` page, there is a field editor where you can add or remove fields, change field details, and drag-n-drop to reorder them. You can also restore the default fields. 

If you have ever used the Advanced Custom Fields or Custom Field Suite plugins, the editor will be very familiar.

[Tutorial](http://www.wpmission.com/tutorials/customize-the-form-in-strong-testimonials/) | [Support](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/strong-testimonials) | [Developer](http://www.wpmission.com/contact)

= How can I change which client fields appear below the testimonial? =

On the `Client Section` tab on `Testimonials > Settings` page. Follow the example to build shortcodes based on your custom fields. There is a shortcode for text fields (like a client's name) and a shortcode for links (like a client's website). When in doubt, use the default template provided.

I admit it can greatly improved but I needed to build something quickly to include in version 1.7 with custom fields. This will be replaced with a field editor in an upcoming version.

= Is this multisite compatible? =

Yes, but I highly recommend first installing the [Proper Network Activation](http://wordpress.org/plugins/proper-network-activation/) plugin when adding Strong Testimonials to a multisite installation. That plugin will deftly handle the plugin activation process, ensuring each site has the default settings.

= Are there templates? How do I change the look of the testimonials? =

Except for the default template, which is rather plain and so 2011, the stylesheets are largely structural so you can add on CSS in your theme or [custom CSS](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/). In fact, I like to skip loading the stylesheets (in `Testimonials > Settings`) to see how they look in the theme, then style up from there. Future versions will have pre-built templates with adjustable colors, borders, etc.

= What about Akismet for the submission form? =

I plan to integrate Akismet and more soon.

= Will it import my existing testimonials? =

Not yet. If you have a ton of testimonials, you may want to wait.

= Can I make a donation? =

Thanks but I prefer a nice [review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/strong-testimonials). Casting a compatibility vote will tell others it works too.

That feedback really helps me understand how people are using my plugins, what works well, and what still needs work.

= Does anybody read these things? =

That's *my* frequently asked question ;) As a reward for reading this far, leave a message [here](http://www.wpmission.com/contact) with "I read the FAQs!" in the subject line to receive one hour of WordPress support absolutely free.
